Twenty-five miles from home, girl  
My feet are hurtin' mighty bad  
Now I've been walkin' for three days  
And two lonely nights  
You know that I'm mighty bad  
But I got a girl waitin' for me  
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile  
You see, she's got the kind  
Of lovin' and kissin'  
Make a boy go stone wild 
I got to keep on walkin'  
Oh I got to walk on  
Let me tell you, y'all  
I'm so tired  
But I just can't lose my stride 
I got fifteen miles to go now  
And I can hear my baby callin' my name  
It's as if, as though  
I'm standin' at her front door  
And I can hear that doggone thing  
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby  
And hold her in my arms one more time  
And when I kiss her lips  
I turn backward flip  
And I forget about these feet of mine 
I got to keep on walkin'  
Oh I got to walk on  
Let me tell you, y'all  
I'm so tired  
But I just can't lose my stride

Hope my feet don't fail me now  
I got five more miles to go  
I got nine, eight, seven  
Six, oh six

Over the hills just around the bend  
Although my feet are tired  
I can't lose my stride  
I got to get my baby back again 
I got to keep on walkin'  
I got to walk on  
Let me tell y'all  
I'm so tired now  
But I just can't lose my stride  
Oh, I got to walk on

All along I had to talk about it  
But like a two edged sword,  
He touched you and it stabs 
All along I knew you were  
A phony girl  
You sit behind the mask  
And you control your world 
You sit around and I watch your face  
I try to find the truth but that's your hiding place  
You say you love me but its hard to see  
Cause when he's in your arms,  
Your throwing rocks at me  
Who do you love?  
Is it me?  
Well, I don't know  
Who do you love?  
That I want  
If you had  
If you knew me 
  
There is nothing in your eyes 
But that's the way you cry, girl  
All is grand, all is bright 
  
I walk around I'm sufferin'  
In my doom  
When I come to you,  
You're sittin' in your room  
You sit around in the strangest place  
So take off the mask  
So I can see your face  
Who do you love? 
Is it me?  
Well, I don't know  
Who do you love?  
That I want ya  
If you had  
I know you 
  
Heaven must be weary 
You got me scared, girl

Heaven must be weary 
You know ooh, babe

When I come to you, you're sitting in your room  
You sit around in the strangest place

Is it me?  
Well, I don't know  
Who do you love?  
Gotta want ya  
If he had

Ben, the two of us need look no more  
We both found what we were looking for  
With a friend to call my own  
I'll never be alone  
And you my friend will see  
You've got a friend in me 
  
Ben, you're always running here and there 
You feel you're not wanted anywhere 
If you ever look behind  
And don't like what you find  
There's something you should know  
You've got a place to go 
  
I used to say, "I" and "me"  
Now it's "us", now it's "we" 
 
Ben, most people would turn you away  
I don't listen to a word they say  
They don't see you as I do  
I wish they would try to  
I'm sure they'd think again  
If they had a friend like Ben 
Like Ben 
Like Ben

I gave you joy, your best of joy  
I am the moonlight you are the spring, ours life's a sacred thing  
You know I always will love you, I am forever  
I am the one who came when you fell down  
I was the only one around   
When things would hurt you  
I am forever, wasn't it I who said that you are free?  
Wonder if it seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you  
I am forever, I am forever  
We are forever, we are forever 
I am your friend, through thick and thin  
We need each other, we'll never part, our love is from the heart  
We never say I don't need you, We are forever  
I am the one who said that you are free  
Wonder if it seems so hard to be , and nothing would cheer you  
I am forever, wasn't it I who carried you around?  
When all the walls came tumbling down 
When things would hurt you  
I am forever, I am forever  
We are forever, we are forever  
You are the sun that lights up the sky, when things are shady  
Let come what may we do get by, I was the only one around   
When things would hurt you  
We are forever, I am forever, we are forever, I am forever  
We are forever, we are forever, our love is strong  
We are forever, we are forever, oh right  
I am forever, we are forever, I am forever, we are forever, we are forever  
I am forever, I am forever

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene  
I said don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one  
Who will dance on the floor in the round  
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round 
She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene  
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one  
Who will dance on the floor in the round 
People always told me be careful of what you do  
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts  
And mother always told me be careful of who you love  
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth 
Billie Jean is not my lover  
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one  
But the kid is not my son  
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
For forty days and forty nights  
The law was on her side  
But who can stand when she's in demand  
Her schemes and plans  
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round  
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice 
  
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me  
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine   
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby 
People always told me be careful of what you do  
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts  
She came and stood right by me  
Just the smell of sweet perfume  
This happened much too soon  
She called me to her room 
Billie Jean is not my lover  
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one  
But the kid is not my son 
Billie Jean is not my lover  
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one  
But the kid is not my son  
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
Billie Jean is not my lover  
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one  
But the kid is not my son  
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one,  
breaking my heart babe)  
She says I am the one 
Billie Jean is not my lover  
Billie Jean is not my lover  
Billie Jean is not my lover  
Billie Jean is not my lover   
Billie Jean is not my lover  
Billie Jean is not my lover

I took my baby on a Saturday bang  
Boy is that girl with you  
Yes we're one and the same 
Now I believe in miracles  
And a miracle has happened tonight 
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white 
They print my message in the Saturday Sun  
I had to tell them I ain't second to none 
And I told about equality and it's true

But, if you're thinkin' about my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white 
I am tired of this devil  
I am tired of this stuff

Sew when the going gets rough  
I ain't scared of your brother  
I ain'ts scared of no sheets  
I ain't scared of nobody  
Girl when the goin' gets mean 
Protection  
For gangs, clubs, and nations  
Causing grief in human relations  
It's a turf war on a global scale  
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale  
See, it's not about races  
Just places  
Faces  
Where your blood comes from  
Is were your space is  
I've seen the bright get duller  
I'm not going to spend my life being a color 
Don't tell me you agree with me  
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye 
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white 
I said if you're thinkin' of being my baby  
It don't matter if you're black or white 
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother  
It don't matter if you're black or white 
Ooh, ooh  
Yea, yea, yea now  
Ooh, ooh  
Yea, yea, yea now 
It's black, it's white  
It's tough for them to get by  
It's black, it's white,  whoo

All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by  
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah  
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when  
I'm trying to get through  
To keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh  
I just want to touch you 
  
I just want to touch and kiss  
And I wish that I could be with you tonight  
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I 
All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real  
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me  
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen  
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true  
Oh baby you give me butterflies 
  
I just want to touch and kiss  
And I wish that I could be with you tonight  
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I 
If you would take my hand, baby I would show you  
Guide you to the light babe  
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you

Don't say goodbye again  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't make me cry, cry, cry  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't make me cry, cry, cry, again  
Again, again 
The more I try, the more you hurt me  
Why?  
Tell me why  
Tell me why 
I can take an Aspirin  
For a bad headache  
But what pill for loneliness can I take? 
I can seal to you  
Just like cellophane  
But I need you, baby  
Like a star needs fame 
You're not another habit  
I have to learn to break  
Let's try to patch it up  
Before it's too late 
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love with you  
I'm in love, in love, in love 
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't make me cry, cry, cry  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't say goodbye again  
Don't make me cry, cry, cry, again 
The more I try, the more you hurt me  
Why?  
Tell me why  
Tell me why 
The more I try, the more you hurt me  
Why?  
Tell me why  
Tell me why

Feels like a fire that burns in my heart  
Every single moment that we spend apart  
I need you around for every day to start  
I haven't left you alone 
Something about you, starin' in your eyes  
And everything I'm looking for I seem to find  
All this time away is killing me inside  
I need your love in my life 
I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again 
We fought in a battle, nobody won  
now we face A mountain to be overcome  
You can't run away, the past is said and done  
I need us to carry on 
I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again 
You'll try everything  
You never thought would work before  
When you live, when you love, and you give them your all  
You can always give up some more 
Baby nothing means anything  
Unless you're here to share with me  
I can breathe, I can bleed, I can die in my sleep  
Cause you're always there in my dreams 
I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again 
I wanna spend time till it ends  
I wanna fall with you again  
Like we did when we first met  
I wanna fall with you again

Sun comes up on this new morning  
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings  
And if these words could have kept you happy 
I'd do anything 
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder  
With a tender touch, you know so well  
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters  
Baby, who can really tell,  
When two hearts belong so well 
Maybe the walls will tumble  
And sun may refuse to shine  
When I say, I love you  
Baby, you've gotta know 
That's for all time  
Baby you gotta know 
That's for all time 
Moon shines down on this good evening  
One warm kiss in this cold night air  
For this good love I'm receiving  
I'll go anywhere  
Just as long as you are there 
And maybe the walls will tumble  
Sun may refuse to shine  
When I say, I love you  
Baby, you've gotta know  
That's for all time 
Baby you gotta know 
That's for all time 
Oh... Oh, oh, oh...  
The sun in me  
Oh... Oh, oh, oh...  
All these words that young lovers say... 
And maybe the walls will crumble  
And sun may refuse to shine  
When I say, I need you  
Baby, you've gotta know  
That's for all time 
Baby you gotta know 
That's for all time 
Baby, you can never go  
Baby, you gotta know  
See that you never go  
That's for all time  
Baby, you never know 
That's for all time...

Love is like a circus and a carnival is beautiful to see  
Love can turn your mind around like Ferris wheels and spinning carousels 
You'll be a part of the world of make believe  
Flying high like a man on a trapeze 
  
Oh, everyday is a holiday  
Get your tickets right away  
Love, love, love  
Is the Greatest Show on Earth 
The fantasy you see is like a child again through rainbow colored eyes  
Step right up its circus time and get your moneys worth of love today 
You'll be a part of the world of make believe  
Flying high like a man on a trapeze 
 
Love, love, love  
Is the greatest show on earth   
Love, love, yea  
Is the greatest show on earth  
Love, love, yea

I've played the game of love before  
Too young to know  
How hard the fall could be  
I never thought I'd try again  
Somehow you brought  
The gambler out in me 
You can deal me in this time around  
Even though the odds are high  
We'll play them down  
You may be a chance I need to take  
And the hand I'm holdin' says it's no mistake 
Happy is the way I'm feelin'  
And I know it comes from being with you  
All at once my life is changin'  
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love  
With you  
Fallin' in love with you  
Fallin' in love  
Fallin' in love with you 
If this is luck then let it ride  
If it's the stars  
They're surely on my side  
I've never been so satisfied  
By love before  
For all the times I've tried 
These beginnings could mean more  
Than the brief affair I bargained for  
Little did I know when we began  
That my time had come to win a hand 
Happy is the way I'm feelin'  
And I know it comes from being with you  
All at once my life is changin'  
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love  
With you  
Fallin' in love with you  
Fallin' in love  
Fallin' in love with you 
Please forgive me if I seem  
To be walking through a waking dream  
Laughter never came so easily  
There's a freedom here that's new to me 
Happy is the way I'm feelin'  
And I know it comes from being with you  
All at once my life is changin'  
And I know it's cause I'm fallin' in love  
With you  
Fallin' in love with you  
Fallin' in love  
Fallin' in love with you

Each time the wind blows  
I hear your voice so  
I call your name  
Whispers at morning  
Our love is dawning  
Heaven's glad you came 
You know how I feel  
This thing can't go wrong  
I'm so proud to say I love you  
Your love's got me high  
I long to get by  
This time is forever  
Love is the answer 
I hear your voice now  
You are my choice now  
The love you bring  
Heaven's in my heart  
At your call  
I hear harps  
And angels sing 
You know how I feel  
This thing can't go wrong  
I can't live my life without you 
I just can't hold on 
I feel we belong  
My life ain't worth living  
If I can't be with you 
I just can't stop loving you  
I just can't stop loving you  
And if I stop  
Then tell me just what will I do 
Cause I just can't stop loving you 
At night when the stars shine  
I pray in you I'll find  
A love so true 
When morning awakes me  
Will you come and take me  
I'll wait for you 
You know how I feel  
I won't stop until  
I hear your voice saying  
"I do" 
"I do"  
This thing can't go wrong 
This feeling's so strong 
Well, my life ain't worth living 
If I can't be with you  
I just can't stop loving you  
I just can't stop loving you  
And if I stop  
Then tell me, just what will I do 
I just can't stop loving you 
We can change all the world tomorrow  
We can sing songs of yesterday  
I can say, hey farewell to sorrow  
This is my life and I,  
Want to see you for always 
I just can't stop loving you  
I just can't stop loving you  
If I can't stop!  
And if I stop  
Then tell me, just what will I do 
I just can't stop loving you  
I just can't stop loving you  
You know I do  
Then tell me, just what will I do

This is it  
Here I stand  
In the light of the world  
Love is grand  
And this love  
I can feel  
And I know  
Yes, for sure  
It is real 
And it seems as though  
I've seen your face a thousand times  
And you know  
That you've seen my face before  
And you said that you don't want me  
To come around  
But many times  
I'm gonna do it to this love 
Ooh, yeah  
I never heard a single word about you  
Falling in love wasn't my plan  
I never thought that I would be your lover  
Come on, please, baby  
I'm trustin' 
This is it  
Here I stand  
With you I've got the world in my hands  
And this love  
That I feel  
Yes, I know  
That's for sure  
This is real 
In my dreams I've seen your face a thousand times  
But I know  
Never felt this way before  
I look at you  
And I can't believe the love I found  
And I know  
That I can never want for more 
I never heard a single word about you  
Falling in love wasn't my plan  
I never thought that I would be your lover  
Come on, baby  
I'm trustin' 
This is it 
Here I am 
I'm in love  
And I'm at your command 
This love  
That I feel 
Never thought it could feel so real 
I can feel you turn the key  
That free my broken heart  
Now I'm not afraid to love  
Against some odds  
And you're everything I know  
That I can want and more  
But I really didn't know it until now  
No, no 
I never heard a single word about you  
Falling in love wasn't my plan  
I never thought that I would be your lover  
Come on, baby  
I'm trustin' 
Oh, yeah  
I never heard a single 
Falling in love wasn't my plan  
I never thought that I could be your lover  
Come on, my baby  
I'm trustin' 
Oh, yeah  
I never heard a single 
Oh, no  
Come on, my baby  
I'm trustin'  
Yeah, yeah  
I'm trustin'  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You see, you see  
I never heard, I never heard  
I never heard, I never heard  
About you

  
Yeah  
The old school  
To the new school  
Bad Boy, remix, let's go 
  
Like that  
Black gon' slide with Mike Jack  
Puff done remixed one hell of a track  
Put me on it  
I wanna know  
How many want it?  
Damn, it feels good to see people love on it  
For those who love slow down  
'Member Motown had a brotha' happy as shit  
I mean the whole sound  
Bangin' and catch six-four since we was shorties  
Fee owes now rebooked from California 
Carry 40's but I 'member them times in '79  
When I first started to rhyme  
Sometimes I gots to look back at what it was  
The good old days  
The triple o'shays when there was love 
I want you back  
But I can't grab that far  
It's how it is  
When you're living like a star, bad boy  
Come on, let's go 
  
When I had you to myself  
I didn't want you around  
Those pretty faces  
Always made you  
Stand out in a crowd  
But someone picked you from the bunch  
When love was all it took  
Now it's much too late for me  
To take a second look 
Oh baby, give me one more chance 
Won't you please let me 
Oh, darlin' I was blind to let you go 
But now since I see you in his arms 
Oh, I do now 
Oh, oh, baby 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Nah, nah, nah, nah 
Trying to live without your love  
Is one long sleepless night  
Let me show you girl  
That I know wrong from right  
Every street you walk on  
I lay tear stains on the ground  
Following the girl  
I didn't even want you around 
Let me tell ya now  
Oh baby all I need is one more chance 
Won't you please let me 
Oh darlin' I was blind to let you go 
But now since I see you in his arms 
 
It's just like Jermain Jackson  
Tito, Mike and Marlon  
Only think on my mind now is stardom  
Blowin' the F-up  
My game's stepped up  
'Member when Mike and them  
First came to record  
Singin' hits like Skywriter  
My Girl, People Make The World Go 'Round  
Mama's Pearl, Can't Loose it  
Joyful jukebox music  
Never Can Say Goodbye  
That's why we use it 
It's money honey  
So I gots to be there  
And I'm be yo Sugar Daddy  
Say it's real  
Versachi chair, pd, life of the party  
Bad Boy, make joys for everbody 
Jackson 5 Chorus in background while: 
  
Motown  
Berry Gordy  
History  
Let's go, come on  
Yeah  
Come on  
Yeah 
This is the remix, come on  
From the old to the new  
Come on  
Motown  
Rock on  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  


If'n I was God  
Well just for spite  
I wouldn't set the sun at night  
'Til everyone was treated right  
By everyone else they see 
If'n I was God  
I'd fix it so without explaining  
Folks would know, they'd know  
What's going on inside  
Of everyone else like me 
Nobody hurt nobody else  
Oh no I wouldn't let it be  
Nobody have a need to pray  
Except for thanking me 
If'n I was God  
I'd make us wise  
So everyone could realize  
That everywhere beneath the sun  
Everyone needs, everyone 
And God that in heaven what I would do  
If'n I was you  
If'n I was God  
Love each other, reach out  
And touch somebody's hand

You and I must make a pact  
We must bring salvation back,  
Where there is love, I'll be there.  
I'll reach out my hand to you  
I'll have faith in all you do.  
Just call my name and I'll be there.  
I'll be there to comfort you,  
Build my world of dreams around you,  
I'm so glad that I found you. 
I'll be there with a love that's strong,  
I'll be your strength,  
I'll keep holdin' on.   
Yes I will 
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter,  
Togetherness, girl, is all I'm after,  
Whenever you need me, I'll be there.  
I'll be there to protect you,   
With unselfish love that respects you.  
Just call my name, I'll be there.  
I'll be there to comfort you,  
Build my world of dreams around you,  
I'm so glad that I found you. 
I'll be there with a love that's strong,  
I'll be your strength,  
I'll keep holdin' on.  
Oh oh oh  
Yes I will   
Yes I will 
If you should ever find someone new  
I know he better be good to you  
Cause if he doesn't  
Ill be there  
Don't you know baby I'll be there  
I'll be there I'll be there 
Just call my name, I'll be there   
Just look over your shoulders honey! Oh!  
I'll be there, I'll be there,  
Whenever you need me, I'll be there  
Don't you know baby,  
I'll be there, I'll be there  
Just call my name, I'll be there   
Oh oh oh oh I'll be there, I'll be there

If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart  
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start  
But girl you just won't approve of the things that I do  
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool 
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me  
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me  
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me  
And he's talking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me 
  
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible  
But I can do anything, she's invincible  
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible  
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible 
Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do  
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to  
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me  
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream 
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me  
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me  
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me  
And he's talking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me 
 
Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do  
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy  
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time  
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed to do for you my baby 


You're not like anybody I ever knew  
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are  
And though I find myself attracted to you  
This time I'm trying not to go too far, cause 
No matter how it starts it ends the same  
Someone's always doing someone more  
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain  
It's only gonna happen again 
  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
All night, all night 
And though I'm trying not to look in your eyes  
Each time I do they kind of burn right through me  
Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies  
And yet my heart is saying come and do me 
  
Now we're just a web of mystery  
A possibility of more to come  
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be  
But here I go falling again 
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high  
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry  
Over you, over you  


Somebody killed little Susie  
The girl with the tune  
Who sings in the daytime at noon  
She was there screaming  
Beating her voice in her doom  
But nobody came to her soon 
A fall down the stairs  
Her dress torn  
Oh the blood in her hair  
A mystery so sullen in air  
She lie there so tenderly  
Fashioned so slenderly  
Lift her with care,  
Oh the blood in her hair 
Everyone came to see  
The girl that now is dead  
So blind stare the eyes in her head  
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said  
This girl lived in vain  
Her face bear such agony, such strain 
But only the man from next door  
Knew Little Susie and how he cried  
As he reached down  
To close Susie's eyes  
She lie there so tenderly  
Fashioned so slenderly  
Lift her with care  
Oh the blood in her hair 
It was all for God's sake  
For her singing the tune  
For someone to feel her despair  
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed  
Then to scream out  
And nobody's there 
She knew no one cared 
Father left home, poor mother died  
Leaving Susie alone  
Grandfather's soul too had flown  
No one to care  
Just to love her  
How much can one bear  
Rejecting the needs in her prayers 
Neglection can kill  
Like a knife in your soul  
Oh it will  
Little Susie fought so hard to live  
She lie there so tenderly  
Fashioned so slenderly  
Lift her with care  
So young and so fair

Up in the heavenly sky  
I only know my heaven is here on earth  
Each time you look into my eyes  
The way.. You do baby 
Thank you, thank you baby 
My beautiful bird you have flown away  
I held you to tight, I can see 
You're all I need to get by  
No one else can make me cry  
The way you do baby 
Chorus:  
You are the book that I read each day  
You are the song That I sing  
Gonna sing it to you  
You are the four seasons of my life  
But maybe tomorrow, you'll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow, you'll come back to my arms girl 
 
Maybe  
You're all I need to get by  
No one else can make me cry  
The way you do baby

Money  
Money 
Lie for it  
Spy for it  
Kill for it  
Die for it 
So you call it trust  
But I say it's just  
In the devil's game  
Of greed and lust 
They don't care  
They'd do me for the money  
They don't care  
They use me for the money 
So you go to church  
Read the holy word  
In the scheme of life  
It's all absurd 
They don't care  
They'd kill for the money  
Do or dare  
The thrill for the money 
You're saluting the flag  
Your country trusts you  
Now you're wearing a badge  
You're called the "Just Few"  
And you're fighting the wars  
A soldier must do  
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but 
If you show me the cash  
Then I will take it  
If you tell me to cry  
Then I will fake it  
If you give me a hand  
Then I will shake it 
You do anything for money 
Anything  
Anything  
Anything for money  
Would lie for you  
Would die for you  
Even sell my soul to the devil 
Anything  
Anything  
Anything for money  
Would lie for you  
Would die for you  
Even sell my soul to the devil 
Insurance?  
Where do your loyalties lie?  
Is that your alibi?  
I don't think so  
You don't care  
You'd do her for the money  
Say it's fair  
You sue her for the money  
Want your pot of gold  
Need the Midas touch  
Bet you sell your soul  
'Cause your God is such  
You don't care  
You kill for the money  
Do or dare  
The thrill for the money 
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?  
Then watch the ones  
With the biggest smiles  
The idle jabbers  
'Cause they're the backstabbers 
If you know it's a lie  
Then you will swear it  
If you give it with guilt  
Then you will bear it  
If it's taking a chance  
Then you will dare it 
You do anything for money 
Anything  
Anything  
Anything for money  
Would lie for you  
Would die for you  
Even sell my soul to the devil 
Anything  
Anything  
Anything for money  
Would lie for you  
Would die for you  
Even sell my soul to the devil 
Anything  
Anything  
Anything for money  
Would lie for you  
Would die for you  
Even sell my soul to the devil 
Anything  
Anything  
Anything for money  
Would lie for you  
Would die for you  
Even sell my soul to the devil 
You say you wouldn't do it  
For all the money in the world  
I don't think so  
If you show me the man  
Then I will sell him  
If you ask me to lie  
Then I will tell him  
If you're stealing with God  
Then you will hell him 
You do anything for money 
  
Anything  
Anything  
Anything for money  
Would lie for you  
Would die for you  
Even sell my soul to the devil

Like a pleasure trip  
Like you've never seen 
Satin lace  
And a paisley cut top  
The girl is waisting over  
And she knows she's just hot  
She got position  
She got just what it takes  
Got a mojo in her pocket  
Got it ready just in case 
She's got the look 
  
She's got the look 
  
That girl's my baby 
 
 
Please no, kick back  
I can't take it  
You're driving me wild  
I might not make it  
You got me looking like buckwheat  
Oh, hair pulled  
Every which way but neat  
Far from Medusa  
But you look so deadly  
Your walk is soft  
Still I hear the medley  
Oh, shiver me timber  
But I do cramp my style  
She drives me wild 
She's got the look  
She's got the look  
She's got the look 
  
She's got the look 
  
That girl's my baby 
 
  

Bass note, treble, stereo control, how low you go  
Just enough to make your juices flow  
Press play, don't stop, rotate, too hot  
You feel I'm real  
I'm everything you need, so tell me what's the deal 
  
Two thousand watts, eight ohms, two hundred volts, real strong  
Too much of that, fuse blown  
Be careful what you say don't overload  
Two thousand watts, eight ohms, two hundred volts, real strong  
Too much of that, fuse blown  
Be careful what you say don't overload 
3D, high speed, feedback, Dolby  
Release two or three, when I reach I can go 'til I hit my peak  
Compact steelo, chico, D-Lo, highpost lady  
Shorty really want to be there for me 


Told me that you're doin' wrong  
Word out shockin' all alone  
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man  
Throwin' rocks to hide your hands  
You ain't done enough for me  
You ain't done enough for me  
You are disgustin' me, yeah yeah  
You're aiming just for me  
You are disgustin' me  
Just want your cut from me  
But too bad, too bad 
Look who just walked in the place  
Dead and stuffy in the face  
Look who's standing if you please  
Though you tried to bring me to my knees 
Too bad too bad about it  
Why don't you scream and shout it  
Too bad too bad about it

Hell all up in Hollywood  
Sayin' that you got it good  
Creepin' from a dusty hole  
Tales of what somebody told 
What do you want from me?  
What do you want from me?  
Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah  
You're aiming just for me  
You are disgustin' me  
You got blood lust for me  
But too bad, too bad 
Look who got slapped in the face  
It's dead and stuffy in the place

Life's about a dream  
I'm really undefeated when MJ is on my team, theme  
Reality brings forth realizm  
It's the man of steel organizm, twizm  
Not from the prizm, take charge like manilla  
Nine five shaq represent with the Thrilla  
Grab my crotch, twist my knee, then I'm through  
Mike's bad, I'm bad  
Who are you

Why don't you scream and shout it  
Too bad too bad about it

As I drove across on the highway  
My jeep began to rock  
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out  
And looked down and noticed I got a flat 
So I walked out, parked the car like sideways  
So I can find what I can fix  
I looked around there were no cars on the highway  
I felt a strange feeling like a mist 
I walked down towards the end of the road  
And in the fog a woman appeared  
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care  
Take my hand, I'll take you there 
Woah-oh  
Take me to a place without no name  
Place without no name  
Take me to a place without no name  
No Name 
As she took me right through the fog  
I see a beautiful city appear  
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and  
No one's in fear 
She said this is the place where no people have pain  
And in love and happiness  
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'  
She grabbed my hand, you got a friend 
Woah-oh  
Take me to a place without no name  
Place without no name  
Take me to a place without no name  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 
Yeah Yeah 
She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me  
She didn't really, really want me to leave  
She showed me places I've never seen things I've never done  
This place really looks like a lotta fun 
I seen the grass and the sky and the birds  
And the flowers surrounded by the trees  
This place is filled with love and happiness  
And not a world could I wanna leave 
So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out  
With my pictures of my family and girl  
This is the place that you choose to be with me  
When you thought you could be in another world 
Ooh-ooh  
Take me to a place without no name  
Place without no name  
Take me to a place without no name  
No name 
Take me to a place without no name  
No Name  
Take me to a place without no name

You ever want something  
That you know you shouldn't have  
The more you know you shouldn't have it,  
The more you want it  
And then one day you get it,  
It's so good too  
But it's just like my girl  
When she's around me  
I just feel so good, so good  
But right now I just feel cold, so cold  
Right down to my bones  
'Cause oh  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
It's not warm when she's away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long  
Anytime she goes away 
Wonder this time where she's gone  
Wonder if she's gone to stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Anytime she goes away 
I know, I know, I know, I know,  
I know, know, know, know, know,  
I know, I know,  
Hey I ought to leave  
I ought to leave her alone  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone 
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Only darkness every day  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Anytime she goes away

You are the promised kiss of springtime  
That makes the lonely winter seem long  
You are the breathless hush of evening  
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song 
You are the angel glow that lights a star  
The dearest things I know are what you are 
Some day my happy arms will hold you  
And some day I'll know that moment divine  
When all the things you are, are mine 
You are the angel glow that lights a star  
The dearest things I know are what you are 
Some day my happy arms will hold you  
And some day I'll know that moment divine  
When all the things you are, are mine

I was a fool  
Too blind to see  
I turned my back  
On all your needs  
What a price  
I almost let you get away 
You're like the precious air I breathe  
Without your love  
I'm not complete  
Now, I know  
And my forever starts today 
'Cause it's alright now with me  
Yes, it's alright now, you see  
I'll be all you'll ever need  
This time 
I can believe in who I am  
Now that you're back with me again  
I can see  
That what is meant will always be 
Let me reach out  
And take your hand  
I'll make you know  
I am your man  
You're the one that I will love eternally 
'Cause it's alright now with me  
Yes, it's alright now, you see  
I'll be all you'll ever need

Last night, an angel came to me  
I was cryin' alone  
My heart was bleeding  
Last night, an angel came to me  
I was cryin' alone  
My mind was dying  
God have mercy 
Stop them destroying me  
An angel came to me  
To save my life  
Listen to his voice  
Please hear his soul  
This angel came to me  
To save me  
Last night, an angel came to me  
I was doing wrong  
I was doing wrong  
Last night, an angel came to me  
I was sleepin' wrong

God have mercy  
Stop them destroying me  
An angel came to me  
To forgive me  
Listen to his prayers  
Please feel his love  
This angel came to me  
God saved me  
An angel came to me  
To fulfill his prophecy  
He listened to my prayers  
Please feel my love  
This angel came to me  
I recognised him  
I recognised him 
Ad libs:  
An angel, baby, did you hear it 
I tell you baby, did you hear it 
I tell you baby, did you hear it 
I tell you honey, did you hear it 
An angel came to me  
An an-gel.

I've seen the lightning leave me  
My baby just can't take  
Her eyes off me

She got your number

She put you under  
It's so insane 
Since you seduced her  
How does it feel  
To know that woman

To know this stranger

Erase the past

It's not about love and romance  
And now you're gonna get it 
Every hot man is out takin' a chance  
It's not about love and romance

Everybody wanting a piece of Michael Jackson

He comes to give it again  
They can put around the world today  
He wanna write my obituary 
No matter what, you just wanna read it again  
No matter what, you just wanna feed it again 
Why is it strange that I would fall in love

Or am I crazy cause I just eloped  
This is breaking news  
This is breaking news 
Everybody watching the news on Michael Jackson  
They wanna see that I fall cause I'm Michael Jackson

Girl  
We used to be one  
I was the moon and you were my sun  
And oh  
We used to love once  
Till you deserted me to hunt down more lunch 
But you  
Can't fool me  
I know exactly whatcha doing  
And you  
Can't burn me, cause I flicked you into your doom 
But still you're trying to burn me  
But it just isn't working! 
You make us burn  
We can make this burn 
You make us burn  
Together we will burn! 
Oh, girl I wanna testify, ooh come on and let me light the fire, we can  
Make it work tonight, rain and thunder when you burn 2 night 
Oh, girl I want to break your cries, ooh come on and watch you fire die, we  
Can make it work tonight, rain and thunder when you burn 2 night

There goes the sunshine  
Here comes the rain  
And heartache things  
What can I do but wait for you  
Darling the days  
I had looked cold 
Now our separate mays we go  
It seems you want more  
Than the love I can give  
But I can't make you stay 
And you got your life to live  
But if it gets too rough  
Call on me 
Dreams of golden glare  
Taking you away from here  
But if ever think that has to be  
Turns your dreams around 
Love and understanding is what you need  
If you can't get enough  
Call on me 
I'm so sad you're leaving  
It's going to kill me  
Not to be with you?  
But I want you to be happy 
If parting is what you want  
Then I want it too  
So goodbye with all my best  
For your happiness in a world that's there 
Should you write and it's not there  
Call on me 
  
Yes, happiness  
Wish you for elsewhere  
We remember this should  
You write and it's not there  
Call on me... call on me 
Yes, happiness  
Wish you for elsewhere  
We remember this should  
You write and it's not there  
Call on me...

Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 
If you look around  
The whole world is comin' together now, baby 
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 
Feel it in the air  
The wind is taking it everywhere, yeah 
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 
All the colours of the world should be  
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly  
Yes, it's all right  
Take my message to your brother  
And tell him twice 
Spread the word and try to teach the man  
Who's hating his brother  
When hate won't do, ooh  
'Cause we're all the same, yes  
The blood inside of me is inside of you 
Now, tell me  
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Yeah, yeah, oh 
Every breath you take  
Is someone's death in another place 
Every healthy smile  
Is hunger and strife to another child 
  
But the stars do shine  
In promising salvation, is near this time 
Can you feel it now?  
So brothers and sisters show me know how 
Now, tell me  
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?  
Yeah yeah oh 
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it? 
All the children in the world should be  
Loving each other wholeheartedly  
Yes, it's all right  
Take my message to your brother  
And tell him twice 
Take the news to the marching men  
Who are killing their brothers  
When death won't do, ooh  
Yes, we're all the same  
Yes, the blood inside of me is inside of you 
Now, tell me  
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?  
Can you feel it? Can you feel it? Can you feel it?

I thought she had to have it  
Since the first time she came  
Who knows the situation  
Mysteries do remain  
And now I wonder why  
I breakdown when I cry  
Is it something I said  
Or is it just a lie 
  
I try so hard to love you  
Some things take  
Time and shame  
I think the whole world  
Of you  
Your thoughts of me remain  
I'll play the fool for you  
I'll change the rules for you  
Just say it and I'll do  
Just make this thing come true 
  
If I let her get away  
Though I'm begging  
On my knees  
I'll be crying everyday  
Knowing the girl  
That got away 
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away 
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away 
I tried to mastermind it  
By saying let it be  
But every time I did it  
The hurt came back at me  
I told you that I need you  
A thousand times and why  
I played the fool for you  
And still you said goodbye 
  
If I let her get away  
Then the world will  
Have to see  
A fool who lives alone  
And the fool who  
Set you free 
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away 
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I've got the feelin' 
Can't let go  
Can't let go 
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away 
I can't let  
I can't let her get away  
I can't let  
I can't let her get away

She's from a world  
Of popcorn and candy  
Pony rides for a dime  
Little children laughing 
I'm from a world  
Of disappointments and confusions  
But I want her to be mine  
I started talking  
She kept on walking  
She disappeared into the crowd 
I lost my heart  
On the carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who left my heart in pieces  
Lost my heart  
On The carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who ran away. 
I was the clown  
And she was the dancer  
We both knew it wouldn't work  
But we took our chances  
What I can't recall  
Is if there was a girl at all  
Or was it my imagination?  
I still remember  
All of those faces  
And now all I have is memories. 
I lost my heart  
On the carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who left my heart in pieces  
Lost my heart  
On The carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who ran away. 
Two different people  
In love for an instant  
To see that the circus came today  
Sometimes I can hear her crying here  
And I can hear her calling me. 
Don't you know?  
I lost my heart  
On the carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who left my heart in pieces  
Lost my heart  
On The carousel  
To a circus girl  
Who ran away

 
  
Your love is like a raging fire  
You're a snake that's on the loose  
The strike is your desire  
But when the centipede is hot  
You're bound to feel the fire  
But when the centipede is hot  
You're bound to feel the fire 
I feel, oh yeah, a longing for your touch  
Like you crawled into the bathroom window  
To give him all your love  
Like a centipede that's hot  
The fire is in your touch  
Just like a centipede you've got  
A lot of loving to touch 
Don't you know  
In the quiet of the night  
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'  
And the moon starts to glow then disappear  
When the time is really right  
Is when the centipede is crawlin'  
You'll be crying in the night  
So many tears  
And crawlin' like a centipede 
  
You came to strike him with your love  
Like you crawled into the bathroom window  
To bite him with your love  
Like a centipede that's hot  
The fire is in your touch  
Just like a centipede you've got  
A lot of lovin' to touch 
Don't you know  
In the quiet of the night  
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'  
And the moon starts to glow then disappear  
When the time is really right  
Is when the centipede is crawlin'  
You'll be crying in the night  
So many tears  
And crawlin' like a centipede 
  
In the quiet of the night  
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'  
And the moon starts to glow then disappear  
When the time is really right  
Is when the centipede is crawlin'  
You'll be crying in the night  
So many tears 
In the quiet of the night  
Is when the snake is in the crawlin'  
And the moon starts to glow then disappear 
When the time is really right  
Is when the centipede is crawlin'  
You'll be crying in the night  
So many tears  
And crawlin' like a centiped 
  


Have you seen my childhood?  
I'm searching for the world that I come from  
Cause I've been looking around  
In the lost and found of my heart  
No one understands me  
They view it as such strange eccentricities  
Cause I keep kidding around  
Like a child, but pardon me 
People say I'm not okay  
Cause I love such elementary things  
It's been my fate to compensate,  
For the childhood  
I've never known 
Have you seen my childhood?  
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth  
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,  
Of conquest and kings on the throne 
Before you judge me, try hard to love me,  
Look within your heart then ask,  
Have you seen my childhood? 
People say I'm strange that way  
Cause I love such elementary things,  
It's been my fate to compensate,  
For the childhood I've never known 
Have you seen my childhood?  
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth  
Like fantastical stories to share  
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly 
Before you judge me, try hard to love me.  
The painful youth I've had 
Have you seen my childhood

Here come ol' flat top  
He come groovin' up slowly  
He's got Joo Joo eyeball  
He one holy roller  
He got hair down to his knees  
Got to be a joker he just do what he please 
He wear no shoeshine  
He's got toe jam football  
He's got monkey finger  
He shoot Coca-Cola

One thing I can tell you is you got to be free 
Come together right now over me 
He bag production  
He's got walrus gum-boot  
He's got Ono sideboard  
He one spinal cracker  
He got feet down through his knees  
Hold you in his armchair  
You can feel his disease 
Come together right now over me 
He roller coaster  
He's got early warning  
He's got muddy water  
He one Mojo filter  
He say "One and one and one is three"  
Got to be good looking 'cause he's so hard to see 
Come together right now over me

Somebody shakes when the wind blows  
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on  
Somebody's lacking a hero  
And they have not a clue  
When it's all gonna end 
Stories buried and untold  
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on  
When will this mystery unfold  
And will the sun ever shine  
In the blind man's eyes when he cries? 
  
You change the world   
You can touch the sky   
You're the chosen one   
If we all cry at the same time tonight 
People laugh when they're feelin sad  
Someone is taking a life, hold on  
Respect to believe in your dreams  
Tell me where were you  
when your children cried last night? 
Faces fill with madness  
Miracles unheard of, hold on  
Faith is found in the winds  
All we have to do  
Is reach for the truth, the truth 
 
And when that flag blows  
There'll be no more wars  
And when all calls  
I will answer all your prayers 
 
Change the world

The way she came into the place  
I knew right then and there  
There was something different  
About this girl 
The way she moved  
Her hair, her face, her lines  
Divinity in motion 
As she stalked the room  
I could feel the aura  
Of her presence  
Every head turned  
Feeling passion and lust 
The girl was persuasive  
The girl I could not trust  
The girl was bad  
The girl was dangerous 
I never knew but I was  
Walking the line  
Come go with me  
I said I have no time  
And don't you pretend we didn't  
Talk on the phone  
My baby cried  
She left me standing alone 
She's so dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money  
Throw away my time  
You can call me honey  
But you're no damn good for me 
She came at me in sections  
With the eyes of desire  
I fell trapped into her  
Web of sin  
A touch, a kiss  
A whisper of love  
I was at the point  
Of no return 
Deep in the darkness of  
Passion's insanity  
I felt taken by lust's  
Strange inhumanity  
This girl was persuasive  
This girl I could not trust  
The girl was bad  
The girl was dangerous 
I never knew  
But I was living in vain  
She called my house  
She said you know my name  
And don't you pretend  
You never did me before  
With tears in her eyes  
My baby walked out the door 
She's so dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money  
Throw away my time  
You can call me honey  
But you're no damn good for me 
Dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
I have to pray to god  
'Cause I know how  
Lust can blind  
It's a passion in my soul  
But you're no damn lover  
Friend of mine 
I can not sleep alone tonight  
My baby left me here tonight  
I cannot cope 'til it's all right  
You and your manipulation  
You hurt my baby 
And then it happened  
She touched me  
For the lips of  
A strange woman  
Drop as a honeycomb  
And her mouth was  
Smoother than oil  
But her inner spirit and words  
Were as sharp as  
A two-edged sword  
But I loved it  
'Cause it's dangerous 
Dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money  
Throw away my time  
You can call me honey  
But you're no damn good for me 
Dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money  
Throw away my time  
You can call me honey  
But you're no damn good for me 
Dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money  
Throw away my time  
You can call me honey  
But you're no damn good for me 
Dangerous  
The girl is so dangerous  
I have to pray to god  
'cause I know how  
Lust can blind  
It's a passion in my soul  
But you're no damn lover  
Friend of mine

She wrote "Dear Michael  
You'll probably never get this letter  
Michael, I wrote you a hundred times before  
Knowing how I feel  
I'll write a hundred more" 
"Dear Michael, every time your record's on 
Michael, I close my eyes and sing along  
Dreaming you're singing to me." 
And then she wrote,  
"Michael, I love you  
I held the tears back long as I can  
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope  
'Cause I want to be more than just your number one fan" 
I'm gonna answer your letter

You never make me stay  
So take your weight off of me  
I know your every move  
So won't you just let me be  
I've been here times before  
But I was to blind to see  
That you seduce every man  
This time you won't seduce me 
She's saying that's ok  
Hey baby do what you please  
I have the stuff the you want  
I am the thing that you need  
She looked me deep in the eyes  
She's touchin' me so to start  
She says there's no turnin' back  
She trapped me in her heart 
Dirty Diana, nah  
Dirty Diana, nah  
Dirty Diana, no  
Dirty Diana

She likes the boys in the band  
She knows when they come to town  
Every musician's fan after the  
curtain comes down  
She waits at backstage doors  
For those who have prestige  
Who promise fortune and fame  
A life that's so carefree 
She's says that's ok  
Hey baby do what you want  
I'll be your night lovin' thing

I didn't call on the phone to  
Say that I'm alright 
Diana walked up to me,

At that I ran to the phone  
Sayin' baby I'm alright

Now she's on the move, she's off to Hollywood  
She said she wanna be a star, she heard the money's good  
She gets off from the train station, a man is waiting there  
"I'll show you where the money is, girl, just let down your hair"  
He's taking her on the streets of Sunset Boulevard  
She's selling her body hot, "Girl, that will take you far"  
The police come 'round the corner 'cause somebody's there, I told  
He's arresting this little girl that's only twelve years old 
Do you know where your children are?  
Because it's now twelve o'clock  
And there's someone out on the street  
Just imagine how scared they are  
Do you know where your children are?  
Because it's now twelve o'clock  
And there's someone out on the street  
Just imagine how scared they are

Don't walk away  
See I just can't find the right thing to say  
I tried but all my pain gets in the way  
Tell me what I have to do so you'll stay  
Should I get down on my knees and pray 
  
And how can I stop losing you  
How can I begin to say  
When there's nothing left to do but walk away 
I close my eyes  
Just to try and see you smile one more time  
But it's been so long now all I do is cry  
Can't we find some love to take this away  
Cause the pain gets stronger every day 
  
How can I begin again  
How am I to understand  
When there's nothing left to do but walk away 
See now why  
All my dreams been broken  
I don't know where we're going  
Everything we said and all we done now  
Don't let go, I don't want to walk away  
Now why  
All my dreams are broken  
Don't know where we're going  
Everything begins to set us free  
Can't you see, I don't want to walk away 
If you go, I won't forget you girl  
Can't you see that you will always be  
Even though I had to let you go  
There' nothing left to do  
Don't walk away

What about sunrise?  
What about rain?  
What about all the things that you said  
We were to gain?  
What about killing fields?  
Is there a time?  
What about all the things  
That you said were yours and mine? 
Did you ever stop to notice  
All the blood we've shed before?  
Did you ever stop to notice  
This crying Earth, these weeping shores? 
Ah, ooh  
Ah, ooh 
What have we done to the world?  
Look what we've done  
What about all the peace  
That you pledge your only son? 
What about flowering fields?  
Is there a time?  
What about all the dreams  
That you said was yours and mine? 
Did you ever stop to notice  
All the children dead from war?  
Did you ever stop to notice  
This crying earth, these weeping shores? 
Ah, ooh  
Ah, ooh 
I used to dream  
I used to glance beyond the stars  
Now I don't know where we are  
Although I know we've drifted far 
Ah, ooh  
Ah, ooh  
Ah, ooh  
Ah, ooh 
Hey, what about yesterday 
What about the seas 
The heavens are falling down 
I can't even breathe 
  
What about apathy 
Burnt despite our pleas 
What about the holy land 
Torn apart by creed 
  
Where did we go wrong 
Someone tell me why 
  
What about babies 
What about the days 
What about all their joy  
Do we give a damn

E-you-P-H-O-are-I-A  
That's the new word for today  
E-you-P-H-O-are-I-A  
It's very easy to say  
Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start  
You can close your eyes  
And see the world with your heart 
Do what you wish, be what you are  
What a victorious thrill  
Wearing a smile, all of the while  
Feeling the world standing still  
Watch rainbows glow rest on a bed of flowers  
Then dial a star  
Anything's in your powers 
Euphoria  
Full euphoria  
Knowing no ills, needing no pills  
Singing a rock and roll hymn  
Feeling glorious, full of love  
Fine from the start  
You can close your eyes  
And see the world with your heart 
How good to be happy and free  
Living the way that you choose  
Healthily and clean  
Can't understand anyone having the blues  
Euphoria never to feel frustration  
How great to give euphoria invitation  
Euphoria, euphoria  
Long as we love each other

Everybody's somebody's fool  
The world is the biggest school  
As you live, you learn though a torch will burn  
Everybody's somebody's fool 
You go through life making fools of others  
Pretending you're giving them love  
But remember sister or brother  
You all have to answer to the one you above 
It's beautiful to watch love begin  
But oh so sad when it ends  
As you got through life remember this rule  
Everybody's somebody's fool 
It's beautiful to watch love begin  
But oh so sad when it ends  
As you got through life remember this rule  
Everybody's somebody's fool

There's a ghost down in the hall  
There's a ghoul upon the bed  
There's something in the walls  
There's blood up on the stairs 
And it's floating through the room  
And there's nothing I can see  
And I know that that's the truth  
Because now it's onto me 
I don't understand it  
Hey  
I don't understand it!  
Aaow 
There's a tappin' in the floor  
There's a creak behind the door  
There's a rocking in the chair  
But there's no-one sitting there 
There's a ghostly smell around  
But nobody to be found  
And a coughin' and a yawnin'  
Where a restless soul is going 
Don't understand it  
Hey!  
Don't understand it  
Hey. 
And who gave you the right to shake my family?  
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me  
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?

Shot an arrow in me!  
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy  
The ghost of jealousy 
There's a tappin in the floor  
There's a creak behind the door  
There's a rocking in the chair  
But nobody's sitting there 
There's a ghostly smell around  
But nobody to be found  
And a coughin' and a yawnin'  
Where a restless soul is going 
Don't understand it!  
Yeah Yeah!

The forest for the trees

Of all the little things I wanted to say  
I really wanted to do  
Girl, this time  
Oh, oh girl I really mean it

Gone too soon 
Like a rainbow  
Fading in the twinkling of an eye  
Gone too soon 
Shiny and sparkly  
And splendidly bright  
Here one day  
Gone one night 
Like the loss of sunlight  
On a cloudy afternoon  
Gone too soon 
Like a castle  
Built upon a sandy beach  
Gone too soon 
Like a perfect flower  
That is just beyond your reach  
Gone too soon 
Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight  
Here one day  
Gone one night 
Like a sunset  
Dying with the rising of the moon  
Gone too soon 
Gone too soon

There's a place in your heart  
And I know that it is love  
And this place could be much  
Brighter than tomorrow  
And if you really try  
You'll find there's no need to cry  
In this place you'll feel  
There's no hurt or sorrow 
There are ways to get there  
If you care enough for the living  
Make a little space  
Make a better place 
Heal the world  
Make it a better place  
For you and for me  
And the entire human race  
There are people dying  
If you care enough for the living  
Make it a better place  
For you and for me 
If you want to know why  
There's love that cannot lie  
Love is strong  
It only cares of joyful giving  
If we try we shall see  
In this bliss we cannot feel  
Fear of dread  
We stop existing and start living 
The it feels that always  
Love's enough for us growing  
So make a better world  
Make a better place 
Heal the world  
Make it a better place  
For you and for me  
And the entire human race  
There are people dying  
If you care enough for the living  
Make a better place for you and for me 
And the dream we were conceived in  
Will reveal a joyful face  
And the world we once believed in  
Will shine again in grace  
Then why do we keep strangling life  
Wound this earth, crucify its soul  
Though it's plain to see  
This world is heavenly  
Be god's glow 
We could fly so high  
Let our spirits never die  
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers  
Create a world with no fear  
Together we cry happy tears  
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares 
We could really get there  
If you cared enough for the living  
Make a little space  
To make a better place 
Heal the world  
Make it a better place  
For you and for me  
And the entire human race  
There are people dying  
If you care enough for the living  
Make a better place for you and for me

Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone  
I don't want nobody else to hold you  
That's a chance I'll take  
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait  
No, if the angels took me from this earth  
I would tell them bring me back to her  
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay  
Heaven can wait 
You're beautiful  
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful  
This love I have for you girl it's incredible  
And I don't know hat I'd do, if I can't be with you  
The world could not go on so every night I pray  
If the Lord should come for me before I wake  
I wouldn't want to go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close  
What good would Heaven be  
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no 
 
Unthinkable  
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone  
The time might come around when you'd be moving on  
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl  
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her  
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were  
What good would Heaven be  
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no 
 
Oh no, can't be without my baby  
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy  
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting  
Ooh  
Oh no, can't be without my baby  
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy  
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting  
Ooh 
 
Just leave us alone, leave us alone  
Please leave us alone

I can't believe that is real  
The way that you made me feel  
A burning deep down inside  
A love that I cannot hide  
I know it's you honey baby, yeah 
That makes the world go round  
And it's keeping me here loving you baby  
Laying all my troubles down  
Here I am baby come and take me  
Here I am baby come and take me 
Take me by the hand  
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me  
Oh.. It always ends up this way  
Me begging you every day  
From love that I cannot hide  
You broke my heart into half  
I know it's you and me  
Baby yeah...

He got kicked in the back  
He say that he needed that  
He hot willed in the face  
Keep daring to motivate  
He say one day you will see  
His place in world history  
He dares to be recognized  
The fires deep in his eyes 
How many victims must there be  
Slaughtered in vain across the land  
And how many struggles must there be  
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan  
Everybody... 
Every day create your history  
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy  
Every soldier dies in his glory  
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty 
Don't let no one get you down  
Keep movin' on higher ground  
Keep flying until

No force of nature can break  
Your will to self motivate

The song of pain and grief across the land  
And how many children have to die  
Before we stand to lend a healing hand

Every path you take you're leaving your legacy  
Every soldier dies in his glory  
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty  
Every day create your history  
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy  
Every hero dreams of chivalry  
Every child should sing together in harmony 
All nations sing  
Let's harmonize all around the world 
How many victims must there be  
Slaughtered in vain across the land  
And how many children must we see  
Before we learn to live as brothers  
And create one family oh... 
Every day create your history  
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy  
Every soldier dies in his glory  
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty  
Every day create your history  
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy  
Every hero dreams of chivalry  
Every child should sing together in harmony 
A soldier dies  
A mother cries  
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes  
All nations sing  
Let's harmonize all around

Looking out  
Across the nighttime  
The city winks a sleepless eye  
Hear her voice  
Shake my window  
Sweet seducing sighs 
Get me out  
Into the nighttime  
Four walls won't hold me tonight  
If this town  
Is just an apple  
Then let me take a bite 
If they say,  
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature  
Why, why, does he do it that way  
If they say,  
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature  
Why, why does he do me that way 
Reaching out  
To touch a stranger  
Electric eyes are everywhere  
See that girl  
She knows I'm watching  
She likes the way I stare 
If they say,  
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature  
Why, why, does he do me that way

 Why why Why why 
Looking out  
Across the morning  
Where the city's heart begins to beat  
Reaching out  
I touch her shoulder  
I'm dreaming of the street 
If they say,  
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature  
Why, why, does he do me that way  
If they say,  
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature  
Why, why does he do me that way

You laughed at me, you made me cry  
You made a joke, then wonder why 
I say "Hello", you say "Goodbye"  
I reach to you, you don't even try 
  
If losing you makes me happy  
Then why does it makes me cry  
Losing you makes you a winner  
Then how did our love ever die 
I'm born to lose, you know it's true  
And here I stand, I'm losing you

Looking in my mirror  
Took me by surprise  
I can't help but see you  
Running often through my mind  
Helpless like a baby  
Sensual disguise  
I can't help but love you  
It is getting better all the time 
  
I can't help it if I wanted to  
I wouldn't help it even if I could  
I can't help it if I wanted to  
I wouldn't help it, no 
Love to run my fingers  
Softly while you sigh  
Love came and possessed you  
Bringing sparkles to your eyes 
Like a trip to heaven  
Heaven is the prize  
And I'm so glad I found you  
You're an angel in disguise 


Verse 1 
Some people say  
I live in a fantasy  
Because I see the world  
Differently  
Visions come to me  
In my sleep  
I closed my eyes  
To see what God is showing me 
Close your eyes  
And imagine with me  
See the wonder  
In every living thing  
If we can live our lives  
The way it is in my dreams  
Love will take us to a place where  
God can be seen 
This is my dream 
I have this dream  
This I believe  
The world a place for all humanity  
If we could take love to it's highest level  
More than the world has ever seen  
I have this dream 
Verse 2 
Let's put Gods love opn display  
Angel of love come my way  
It really up to you and me  
One world together in harmony 
In my dream I see heaven  
And the face of the one perfect being  
I see people turning into angels  
And God giving them their wings 
This is my dream 
Chorus 
I have this dream  
This I believe  
The world's a place  
For all humanity 
If we could take love  
To it's highest level  
More than the world has ever seen  
I have this dream 
Repeat chorus

You're givin' me true love  
And everyday I thank the Lord  
For a feeling that's so new  
So inviting so exciting 
Whenever your near, I hear a symphony  
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms  
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine  
A feeling so divine, still I need a path because  
I'm lost in a world made for you and me 
Baby, baby  
I hear a symphony, baby  
Whenever your near, I hear a symphony  
Played sweet and tenderly  
Every time your lips meet mine, my baby 
Baby, baby  
I feel the joy begin  
Don't let this feeling end  
Let it go on and on and on now, baby 
Baby, baby  
Those tears that filled my eyes  
I cried not for myself  
But for those who have never felt the joy of love 
Baby, baby  
Whenever your near  
I hear a symphony  
Each time you speak of me  
I hear a tender note so sweet of love 
Baby, baby  
As you stand there holding me  
Whispering how much you care  
A thousand violins fill the air, now 
Baby, baby  
Don't let this moment end  
Keep standing close to me  
So close to me my baby, baby, baby 
Baby, baby  
I hear a symphony  
A tender melody  
I hear a symphony

Maybe you and I can't do great things  
We may not change the world in one day  
But we still can change some things today  
In our small way 
Empty words are not enough  
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush  
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup  
Because we care we love enough to share 
 
In despair we'll be the hope  
And the prayer that frees the soul  
We'll be there to share each lonely road  
Because we love, I know  
We care enough 
 
Just a little time is all it takes  
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see  
Love is all we need

There's a ghost out in the hall  
There's a goul beneath the bed  
Now it's coming through the walls  
Now it's coming down the stairs 
Then there's screaming in the dark  
Hear the beating of his heart  
Can you feel it in the air  
Ghosts be hiding everywhere 
I'm gonna be  
Exactly what you want to see  
It's you who's haunting me  
You're warning me  
To be the stranger  
In your life 
Am I amusing you  
Or just confusing you  
Am I the beast  
You visualized  
And if you want to see  
Eccentrialities  
I'll be grotesque  
Before your eyes 
Let them all materialize  
Is that scary for you, baby  
Am I scary for you, oh  
Is it scary for you, baby  
Is it scary for you  
You know the stranger is you  
Is it scary for you, baby 
There's a creak beneath the floor  
There's a creak behind the door  
There's a rocking in the chair  
But nobody sitting there  
There's a ghostly smell around  
But nobody to be found  
And a coughin' and a yawnin'  
Where restless soul's spoke 
I'm gonna be  
Exactly what you gonna see  
So did you come to me  
To see your fantasies  
Performed before your very eyes 
A haunting ghostly treat  
The foolish trickery  
And spirits dancing  
In the light 
But if you came to see  
The truth the purity  
It's here inside  
A lonely heart 
So let the performance start  
Is that scary for you, baby  
Am I scary for you, oh  
Am I scary for you, baby  
Am I scary for you  
So tell me is it scary for you, baby  
So tell me is it crazy for you, baby  
Am I scary for you  
You know the stranger is you  
Am I scary for ya 
Masquerade the heart  
Is the height of haunting souls  
Just not what you seek of me  
Can the heart reveal the proof  
Like a mirror reveals the truth  
See the evil one is you 
Is that scary for you, baby  
Am I scary for you, oh  
Am I scary for you, baby  
Is it scary for you  
So tell me am I scary for you, baby  
Am I scary for ya, baby  
Is is scary for ya, baby  
Am I scary for you 
  
Am I scary for you, baby  
Am I scary for you  
I'm tired of being abused  
You know you're scaring me too  
I see the evil is you  
Is it scary for you, baby

Miles away, oceans apart  
Never been my sight always in my heart  
The love is always there it will never die  
Only growing stronger tears down my eye  
I am thinking all the time  
When the day will come  
Standing there before you  
Accept this Hajj of mine  
Standing in ihram, making my tawaf  
Drinking blessings from your well  
The challenges that I have suffered  
Rekindles my imaan  
O Allah! I am waiting for the call  
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall  
O Allah! I am waiting for the call  
Praying for the day when I can be near Your Kabah wall  
I feel alive and I feel strong 
I can feel Islam running in my Veins  
To see my Muslim brothers, their purpose all the same  
Greeting one another, exalting one True Name  
I truly hope one day that everyone's a Muslim.  
That they remember you in everything they say  
Standing in ihram making my tawaf, making my tawaf  
Drinking blessings from your well  
The challenges that I have suffered  
Rekindles my imaan  
O Allah! I am waiting for the call  
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall  
O Allah! I am waiting for the call  
Praying for the day when I can be near Your Kabah wall

Too Late  
Too Late  
Too Late  
In this almighty cage  
We shop through the yellow page  
Gone is the corner store  
There is a supermarket there for you 
But feelings remain the same 
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
Well it's too late, too late to change the time  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
But it's not too late to change your mind  
It's a new day, a new age  
A photograph is taken, its ready one minute later  
Cars are bigger and better  
Manufacture satisfy  
Any world full of crime  
I can't let you take 
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
But it's not too late to change your mind   
No, no 
So you want to be a star  
I think you are  
You don't have to go further  
Then my loving arms 
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
But it's not too late  to change your mind 
Are you sure you want to go to New York City   
Where girls make it big if their pretty   
Let say you get that penthouse view  
But whose gonna love you the way I do  
It's too late, too late to change the time  
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
No, too late, too late to change the time  
But it's not too late  to change your mind  
Yea, yea, yea 
And it's too late, too late to change the time  
It's too late, too late to change the time  
Ooh, too late, too late to change the time  
But it's not too late  to change your mind  
Yea, yea, yea 
Too late, too late

I Want You Back  
When I had you to myself  
I didn't want you around  
Those pretty faces always made you  
Stand out in a crowd 
Then someone picked you from the bunch  
One glance was all it took  
Now it's much too late for me  
To take a second look 
Oh, baby, give me one more chance 
Won't you please let me 
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go 
But now since I see you in his arms 
I want you back  
Yes, I do now   
Ooh, ooh, baby   
Yeah, yeah, yeah   
Now, now, now 
The Love You Save  
When we played tag in grade school  
You wanted to be it  
But chasin' boys was just a fad  
You crossed your heart, you'd quit  
When we grew up you traded  
Your promise for my ring  
Now just like back in grade school  
You're doing the same old thing 
Stop, the love you save maybe your own  
Darlin' take it slow  
Or some day you'll be all alone 
  
Darlin' look both ways before you cross me  
You're heading for a danger zone 
I'll Be There  
You and I must make a pact  
We must bring salvation back  
Where there is love  
I'll be there 
  
I'll reach out my hand to you  
I'll have faith in all you do  
Just call my name and I'll be there 
  
I'll be there to comfort you  
Build my world of dreams around you  
I'm so glad that I found you  
I'll be there  
With a love that's strong  
I'll be your strength  
I'll keep holdin' on, ooh 
  
If you should ever find someone new  
I know he'd better being good to you  
'Cause if he doesn't  
I'll be there  
Don't you know, baby, yeah, yeah  
I'll be there  
I'll be there  
Just call my name and I'll be there  
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh  
I'll be there  
I'll be there 
Just call my name, and I'll be there

Nation to nation, all the world must come together,  
Face the problems that we see,  
Then maybe somehow we can work it out.  
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said, later.  
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?  
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be.  
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?  
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears,  
But we must live each day like it's the last.  
Go with it, go with it. 
  
Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,  
It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam.  
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,  
It ain't, don't you, it ain't too much for me to 
The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts,  
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out.  
I told my brother, don't you ask me for no favors,  
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout.  
She pray to God to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song.  
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?  
I just want you to recognize me, I'm the temple,  
You can't hurt me, I found peace within myself.  
Go with it, go with it. 
 
  
Uh, huh, it ain't too much stuff, it ain't too much  
It ain't too much for me to jam.  
It ain't, it ain't too much stuff, it ain't, don't you,  
It ain't too much for me to 
Jam, jam, here comes the man, hot damn,  
The big boy stands, movin' up a hand.  
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson,  
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed.  
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle, bum rushed to door 3 and 4's in a
bundle.  
Execute the plan, first I cooled like a fan,  
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael 'cause it ain't hard to 
 
 
  
Jam. It ain't, it ain't too much stuff,  
It ain't too much, it ain't too much for me to jam.  
Uh, huh, it ain't too much stuff, it ain't, don't you,  
It ain't too much for me to

Free and untamed that's how I've grown  
Settling down ain't my nature  
Roots I'll never own  
Oh your smile  
But tell me, ain't your child  
How can you cage a bird  
Born to be wild 
  
I'm Johnny Raven by and by  
Oh, I'm going to leave your nest girl  
Another nest to try  
Ooh Johnny Raven  
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you  
Yeah, but I gotta leave you  
When my restless heart says goodbye 
Look at you little girl  
You feel love so deep  
If I could change in a second  
I'd change for you like that  
Stay right here for keeps  
But I'm home free for no thrills  
Stray I will  
Seems I gotta need one girl  
Never can feel 
 
Everybody knows my name  
I'm Johnny Raven yeah, yeah by and by  
I'm gonna fly  
When you cry part of me's gonna die

Just a little bit of you every day  
Will surely keep the doctor away  
Just a little bit of you every day  
Will surely keep the doctor away 
I told my mama how I feel about your power  
Your love can heal, can't no doctor's remedy  
Ever do what you do for me 
Just a little bit of you every day  
Will surely keep the doctor away  
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love  
Baby it's all I need, it's all I need 
Since the day I've been loving you  
I can't catch a cold, I can't catch the flu'  
The sweet loving you've been giving me  
Has become my daily need 
Just a little o' your love, every day  
It's all I need, that's all I need  
Just a little bit baby  
That's all I need, that's all I need 
So don't send no doctor to my door  
'Cause Doctor John been here before  
Don't you send him, just come yourself  
Bring your loving and nothing else 
Ooh just a, just a,  
Just a little bit of you every day  
Will surely keep the doctor away  
Just a little bit of you every day  
Will surely keep the doctor away

 
You and me  
We've traded hearts  
I guess that's how  
It always starts out  
And then I guess it always ends 
Look at us 
Sayin'  
I don't think that you and me  
Can just be friends  
Maybe this is how the whole thing  
Has to just end 
And if we could  
Have loved enough 
We would have handled  
When it got rough  
But one of us let go too soon 
So here we are 
Now sayin'  
I don't think that you and me  
Can just be friends  
Maybe this is how the whole thing  
Has to just end 
I wish you'd understand... 
It's funny how  
When love has gone  
There's only one left holdin' on  
When someone's always hurtin' more  
Still lonely for the other 
Sayin'  
I don't think that you and me  
Can just be friends 
I don't ever wanna feel so much again  
Feel again...  
Unless it's you..  
You... Again 
  
I guess that's how it always starts out  
And then I guess  
It always ends 
Look at us 
  
Now sayin'  
I don't think that you and me  
Can just be friends 
Maybe this is how the whole thing  
Has to just end? 
La la dee, la la dee dah dah, la la dah, la la dah, la la dah, la...

If you call out loud  
Will it get inside  
Through the heart of your surrender  
To your alibis  
And you can say the words  
Like you understand  
But the power's in believing  
So give yourself  
A chance 
'cause you can  
Climb the highest mountain  
Swim the deepest sea, hee  
All you need is the will to want it  
And, little self-esteem 
So keep the faith  
Don't let nobody turn you 'round  
You gotta know when it's good to go  
To get your dreams up off the ground 
Keep the faith, baby, yea  
Because it's just a matter of time  
Before your confidence will win out  
Believe in yourself no matter what it's gon' take  
You can be a winner  
But you got to keep the faith 
gon' keep it brother  
You got it  
And when you think of trust  
Does it lead you home  
To a place that you only dream of when you're all alone  
And you can go by feel  
'stead of circumstance  
But the power's in beliving  
So give yourself a chance 
I know that you can  
Sail across the water  
Float across the sky, high  
Any road that you take will get you there  
If you only try 
So keep the faith, ow  
Don't let nobody take you down, brother  
Just keep your eyes on the prize  
And your feet flat on the ground  
Keep the faith, baby, yea  
Because it's just a matter of time  
Before your confidence will win out 
I told my brother how to do the thing right  
Lift up your head and show the world you got pride  
Go for what you want, don't let 'em get in your way  
You can be a winner,  
But you got to keep the faith  
Gon' keep it brother  
You got it  
I know that keepin' the faith  
Means never givin' up on love  
But the power that love has  
To make it right  
Makes it  
Makes it right 
Keep the faith  
Don't let nobody turn you 'round brother  
You got to know when it's good to go  
To get your dreams up off the ground  
Keep the faith  
Baby, yea  
Because it's just a matter of time  
Before your confidence will win out 
Better stand up and act like you wanna do right  
Don't play the fool for the rest of your life  
Work on it brother and you'll make it someday  
Go for what you want and don't forget the faith  
Look at yourself and what you're doin' right now  
Stand back a minute just to check yourself out  
Straighten out your life and how you're livin' each day  
Get yourself together, 'cause you got to keep the faith  
Uh, uh, uh 
Don't let nobody take you down, brother  
Just keep your eyes on the prize  
And your feet flat on the ground  
Keep the faith, baby, yea  
Because it's just a matter of time  
Before your confidence will win out  
Lift up your mind  
Before your mind gets blown  
Some things in life you best just leave them alone  
Go for what you want  
Don't let it get in your way  
You can make it happen  
But ya got ta keep the faith 
Gon' keep it brother  
You got to keep the faith

How to do the thing right  
Lift up your head and show the world you got pride  
Go for what you want  
Don't let 'em get in your way  
You can be a winner if you keep the faith 
Straighten out yourself and get your mind on track  
Dust off your butt and get your self-respect back  
You've known me long enough to know that I don't play  
Take it like you want it but you got to keep the faith  
Gon' 
Don't let nobody take you down  
Just keep your eyes on the prize  
And get your feet back on the ground  
Keep the faith, baby, yea  
Because it's lust a matter of time  
Before your confidence will win out 
But till that day  
I said you've got to keep the faith!

She's lookin' for a job and a finer place to stay,  
She's lookin' for the hope in the empty promising,  
She's workin' two jobs, keepin' alive,  
She works in a restaurant, night and day  
She waits her life away  
She wipes the tears away 
She cries inside every time she feels this way,  
And she's dying inside every time her baby cries, no

Liberian girl  
You came and you changed my world  
A love so brand new  
Liberian girl  
You came and you changed my world  
A feeling so true 
Liberian girl  
You know that you came

"Do you love me"  
And he says so endlessly  
"I love you, Liberian girl"

When you have to say  
"I do"  
And I'll smile and say it too,  
I love you, Liberian girl, all the time 
  
I love you liberian girl, all the time 
I love you liberian girl, all the time 
I love you liberian girl, all the time 
I love you  
I love you baby 
I want you  
I love you baby 
Ooh! I love you baby, I want you baby, ooh!  


I watch the snowflake fall  
Against my window pane  
And wonder if you  
Are watchin' snowflakes too  
I take a walk downtown  
To where you used to meet me  
There's joy everywhere  
But all that waiting there is 
  
Just a little Christmas tree  
Lookin' sorta sad and lonely just like me  
No one seems to care  
They just went away and left it standing there  
All alone on Christmas Eve 
I hear the Christmas bells 
The happy people singing  
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears  
I sadly close my eyes  
And say a little bear  
You'll be waiting there for me  
I look but all I see is 
 
This is the season of love 
But I'm as sad as I can be 
Why did you have to leave me 
 


Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries  
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home  
Just say you will, just say you will, say you will  
My heart is cryin', cryin' 
Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries  
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home  
Just say you will, just say you will, yeah baby  
Say you will 
Just give me another chance for a romance  
Come on and tell me when do you return  
'Cause everyday that you been gone away  
You know my heart does nothin' but burn, cry 
Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries  
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home  
Just say you will, say you will, say you will  
Come on, come on, say it right now baby 
Come on, come on, say that you will  
Come on, say it right now baby  
Say that you will, come on, come on  
Say that you will  
Come on, come on, say that you will  
Come on, come on, come on, say that you will

Ah I feel a fountain in my brain  
Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain  
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears  
Heart so sad 'cause love's gone bad 
I see a rainbow all in black  
Must be a sign that you ain't comin' back  
Wake up at night callin' your name  
I see a face on my window pane 
I've been this way since you've been gone  
Without your love I can't go on  
Look in the mirror, what do I see?  
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me  
Now where's the love you promised me?  
Where's he tenderness to comfort me? 
Everytime some love I choose  
I seem to always be the one to lose  
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears  
Heart fells sad 'cause love's gone bad  
Love's gone bad, heart fells bad 
Black crows flying up above  
It's a sign that I live life without love  
Slime's on the man, slime's ont the sea  
Slime's everywhere I said I'm destined to be 
And this world where nothing's right  
Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night  
You said you'd be true to me  
Instead you made a fool out of me  
Heart feels sad, love's gone bad

Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?  
You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night  
And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed  
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head  
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed 
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do  
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
Hello, midnight lover, you're the one I adore  
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more  
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you  
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, a love forever true  
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you 
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do  
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
It seems you don't know we reached the hightened mountain  
Every time I seem to disappear  
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven  
I can really feel it when you're near 
And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed  
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head  
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed 
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do  
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do  
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do  
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do  
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do  
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do  
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do 
Loving you, that's what I want to do

I'm gonna make a change  
For once in my life  
It's gonna feel real good  
Gonna make a difference  
Gonna make it right 
As I, turn up the collar on  
My favorite winter coat  
This wind is blowing my mind  
I see the kids in the streets  
With not enough to eat  
Who am I to be blind?  
Pretending not to see their needs 
A summer disregard, a broken bottle top  
And a one man soul  
They follow each other on the wind ya' know  
'Cause they got nowhere to go  
That's why I want you to know 
I'm starting with the man in the mirror  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
And no message could have been any clearer  
If you want to make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change 
I've been a victim of a selfish kind of love  
It's time that I realize  
That there are some with no home, not a nickel to loan  
Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone? 
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart  
And a washed-out dream  
They follow the pattern of the wind ya' see  
'Cause they got no place to be  
That's why I'm starting with me 
I'm starting with the man in the mirror  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
And no message could have been any clearer  
If you want to make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself, and then make a change 
I'm starting with the man in the mirror  
I'm asking him to change his ways  
And no message could have been any clearer  
If you want to make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself and then make that  
Change! 
I'm starting with the man in the mirror 
I'm asking him to change his ways 
No message could have been any clearer  
If you want to make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself and then make the change)  
You gotta get it right, while you got the time  
You can't close your, your mind! 
  
That man, that man, that man, that man  
With the man in the mirror 
That man, that man, that man  
I'm asking him to change his ways 
No message could have been any clearer  
If you want to make the world a better place  
Take a look at yourself and then make the change 
Oh no, no no 
I'm gonna make a change  
It's gonna feel real good!  
Chime on! 
Just lift yourself  
You know  
You've got to stop it  
Yourself! 
I've got to make that change, today!  
Hoo! 
You got to  
You got to not let yourself  
Brother  
Hoo! 
You know, I've got to get  
That man, that man 
You've got to move! Chime on!  
Chime on!  
You got to  
Stand up! Stand up! Stand up! 
Stand up and lift yourself, now! 
You know it!  
You know it!  
You know it!  
You know it 
Make that change

I woke up yesterday  
Knowing I was lost and passed away  
I felt my destiny were sad the rain  
Going know her way 
There's sound of the melody  
I got song you enchanted me  
And the sound of your voice  
Make my heart keep turn  
To the music got to love that filled my mind  
Melodie, you're my symphony  
All the song to me  
You're my only 
Melodie, you're my everything  
Make me want to sing  
For you only  
Oh, oh 
  
The long and winding road  
Is much shorter now that you're here with me  
But when you lend my mind  
Have an answer now love don't hold me  
All the girls have brighten now  
And the darkness is lighter now  
Is my mind I can hear  
The band start to play  
Hello tomorrow  
Goodbye you today 
Melodie, you're my symphony  
All the song to me  
You're my only 
Melodie, you're my everything

Melodie, you're my everything  
Make me want to sing  
For you only

Morning glow morning glow  
Starts to glimmer when you know  
Winds of change are set to blow  
And sweep this whole land through  
Morning glow is long past due 
Morning glow fill the earth  
Come on shine far all you're worth  
We'll be present at the birth  
Of all faith looking new  
Morning glow is long past due 
Oh oh morning glow  
I'd like to help you grow  
You should have started long ago 
Morning glow all days long  
For we sing tomorrow's song  
Never knew we could be so strong  
But now it's very clear  
Morning glow is almost here 
Oh oh morning glow  
I'd like to help you grow  
We should have started long ago 
Morning glow all your life  
We can make the new day right  
All the bad songs of the night  
Will fade into the past  
Morning glow is here at last

She's there just sitting at the table  
Thinking out that things won't be the same  
And wouldn't you like to go with me  
And she answered "no" to me  
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon 
I never thought she'd leave me here forever  
But who knows just what the future brings  
And wouldn't you like to go with me  
And she answered "no" to me  
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon 
Take away this never ending sorrow  
Take this lonely feeling from my soul  
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow  
She'd be sitting here beside me  
And my heart would dimly go 
I hope to make a change now for the better  
Never letting fate control my soul  
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see  
The day that she'll come back to me  
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon 
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soon.

We've been together for such a long time now  
Music, music and me  
Don't care wether all our songs rhyme  
Now music, music and me 
Only know wherever I go  
We're as close as two friends can be  
There have been others  
But never two lovers  
Like music, music and me 
Grab a song and come along  
You can sing your melody  
In your mind you will find  
A world of sweet harmony 
Birds of a feather will fly together  
Now music, music and me  
Music and me

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day  
When it's cold outside I've got the month of May  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl   
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
I've got so much honey the bees envy me  
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl   
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  
Ooh 
I don't need no money, fortune, or fame  
I've got all the riches baby one man can claim  
I guess you'd say  
What can make me feel this way?  
My girl   
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
I've got sunshine on a cloudy day  
With my girl 
I've even got the month of May  
With my girl

When the world is on your shoulder  
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down  
If you can't hang with the feelin'  
Then there ain't no room for you this part of town  
'Cause we're the party people night and day  
Livin' crazy that's the only way 
  
So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf  
And just enjoy yourself  
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you  
Life ain't so bad at all  
If you live it off the wall  
Life ain't so bad at all   
Live your life off the wall  
You can shout out all you want to  
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all getting loud  
If you take the chance and do it  
There there ain't no one who's gonna put you down  
'Cause we're the party people night and day  
Livin' crazy that's the only way 
 
Do what you want to do  
There ain't no rules it's up to you   
It's time to come alive  
And party on right through the night  
Gotta hide your inhibitions  
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul  
Want to see an exhibition  
Better do it now before you get too old  
'Cause we're the party people night and day  
Livin' crazy that's the only way 
 
So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf  
And just enjoy yourself  
Come on and groove  and let the madness in the music get to you  
Life ain't so bad at all  
If you live it off the wall 
So tonight gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf  
And just enjoy yourself  
Come on and groove  and let the madness in the music get to you  
Life ain't so bad at all  
If you live it off the wall

One day in your life  
You'll remember a place  
Someone touching your face  
You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll 
One day in your life  
You'll remember the love you found here  
You'll remember me somehow  
Though you don't need me now  
I will stay in your heart  
And when things fall apart  
You'll remember one day 
One day in your life  
When you find that you're always waiting  
For a love we used to share  
Just call my name, and I'll be there  
You'll remember me somehow  
Though you don't need me now  
I will stay in your heart  
And when things fall apart  
You'll remember one day 
One day in your life  
When you find that you're always lonely  
For a love we used to share  
Just call my name, and I'll be there.

People 
People make the world go 'round 
  
Teachers on strike, no more school today  
They want more money but the board won't pay  
People  
Everybody's talkin' 'bout ecology  
The air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe  
People 
  
But that's what makes the world go round  
The ups and downs a carousel  
Changing people's heads around  
Go underground young men  
People make the world go round 
Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear  
They'd swear you're a Hippy if you have long hair  
Young politicians fight for poverty  
While people still cry for equality 


Why can't you admit  
You've done of what's you've told  
Like the dog waiting for the bone  
You greed, can't you, just tell the truth  
You did what you have to,  
And so you decided to sold me, out  
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,  
So this time, the revenge will be mine  
And I'll give it all back to you 
Close your eyes and count to the ten,  
This won't take a long, just a few seconds   
It doesn't hurt so much either, I'll promise it 
  
The pain you made, the pressure you gave  
I held it all, inside of me 'til I past  
Now I shall salute you, the assassin of 2012  
Are you clapping your hands together, that's what I assume 
Tonight you'll suffer with the endless pain,  
Dying while dreaming of my forgiveness,  
So this time, I feel like I win 
You should just left me on my own  
And take those steps back before you told  
That you can be trusted but seems like you don't 
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,  
So this time, the revenge will be mine  
And I'll give it all back to you 
Tonight you'll suffer,  
Of what pressure you made me go trough,  
So this time, doesn't it hurt and yeah, I love you.

I took my baby on a river boat cruise  
And she was well aware  
I was excited about the way things could have been  
Cause in it I don't care  
I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise  
Someone called out my name  
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab  
My joy has turned to pain 
Father always told me  
You won't live a quiet life  
If you're reaching for fortune and fame  
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win  
I'm down in my pain, don't you feel it?  
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame  
So don't be feelin' no pain!  
It's the price of fame, it's the price of fame  
So don't you ever complain! 
I'm on, the cover of the magazine, what a scene  
They know my every do's  
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine" ?  
That always bothers me  
Get in your car, you wanna take a ride, look behind  
Someone is following you  
You try to get away you turn real fast, but too bad  
They know your every move! 
My father always told me  
You won't live a quiet life  
If you're reaching for fortune and fame  
I feel the pressure setting in, I'm living just to win  
I bleed all this pain, don't you ever complain! 
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame  
So don't you ever complain!  
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame  
So don't be feelin' no pain! 
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame!  
Father never lies, my father never lies  
My father never lies  
So don't be feelin' this way boy! 
I'd like to take some time and get away, then they'll say  
Is that boy still alive?  
The week in village what a thrill  
Only the strong survive 
My father always told me  
You won't live a quiet life  
They startin' to wonderin' where have you been?  
I feel their envious looks at me  
Their mistaken jealousy  
Then stand here in my shoes  
And then get a taste of my blues! 
It's the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain!  
It's the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame  
So don't be feelin' this way!  
It's the price of fame  
You pay the price of fame, so don't you ever complain! 
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame!  
Father never lies, my father never lies baby  
My father never lies  
So don't be feelin' no pain boy!

Ain't the pictures enough, why do you go through so much  
To get the story you need, so you can bury me  
You've got the people confused, you tell the stories you choose  
You try to get me to lose the man I really am 
You keep on stalking me, invading my privacy  
Won't you just let me be  
Cause you cameras can't control, the minds of those who know  
That you'll even sell your soul just to get a story sold 
  
I need my privacy, I need my privacy  
So paparazzi, get away from me 
Some of you still wonder why, one of my friends had to die  
To get a message across, that yet you haven't heard  
My friend was chased and confused, like many others I knew  
But on that cold winter night, my pride was snatched away 
Now she get no second chance, she just ridiculed and harassed  
Please tell my why  
No there's a lesson to learn, respect's not given, it's earned  
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity 
 
Now there's a lesson to learn, stories are twisted and turned  
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity 


Do you remember  
When we fell in love  
We were so young and innocent then  
Do you remember  
How it all began  
It just seemed like heaven so why did it end? 
Do you remember  
Back in the fall  
We'd be together all day long  
Do you remember  
Us holding hands  
In each other's eyes we'd stare

All the things we said like  
I love you so I'll never let you go 
Do you remember  
Back in the Spring  
Every morning birds would sing  
Do you remember  
Those special times  
They'll just go on and on  
In the back of my mind 
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
When we first met girl  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time 
Those sweet memories  
Will always be dear to me  
And girl no matter what was said  
I will never forget what we had  
Now baby! 
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
When we first met  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time 
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time  
When we first met  
Do you remember the time  
When we fell in love  
Do you remember the time 
Remember the times

In the park, on the beach  
Remember the times  
You and me in Spain

I'm gonna keep it stong  
Out of holdin' on to you.  
Noone can do me like you do.  
Its true. 
Michael:  
Reaching out  
Touch a stranger  
Eletric eyes of everywhere  
See that girl  
She knows I'm watching  
She likes the way I stare 
 
Swv:  
Won't let go  
You should know  
This thing is real  
Don't rush now  
Just listen to your heart  
And love will be right here 
Be right here 
Right here  
Loves gonna be right here, yea  
Loves gonna be  
Loves gonna be 


He rocks in the tree tops all day long  
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song  
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street  
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 
  
Rockin' robin, rock rock  
Rockin' robin'  
Blow rockin' robin  
'Cause we're really gonna rock tonight 
Every little swallow, every chick-a-dee  
Every little bird in the tall oak tree  
The wise old owl, the big black crow  
Flappin' their wings singing go bird go 
 
Pretty little raven at the bird-band stand  
Told them how to do the bob and it was grand  
They started going steady and bless my soul  
He out-bopped the buzzard and the oriole 
He rocks in the tree tops all day long  
Hoppin' and a-boppin' and singing his song  
All the little birdies on Jaybird Street  
Love to hear the robin go tweet tweet tweet 


 
Save me...  
Save me... 
She's not a star  
But she'll go far  
So she's telling all her friends  
She's only young and just begun  
To see clearly  
In her eyes 
Nothing turned out like she thought it would 
And I was waiting right there where she stood 
She said: save me  
From this wicked world I'm livin' in  
She said: save me  
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win  
I can't run and I can't hide 
I can't run and I can't hide 
She said: save me 
She said save me...  
Ooh! 
All on her own  
She's on the phone  
So sincerely...  
Ooh... Makin' a joke  
There's no reply  
She wonders why  
And pays the rent one more time 
Everybody's out there on the take 
And I was there when she began to brake 
  
She said: save me  
From this wicked world I'm livin' in 
She said: save me  
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win  
I can't run and I can't hide 
I can't run and I can't hide 
She said: save me 
She said save me...  
Ooh! 
Everybody's out there on the take 
And I was there when she began to brake 
She said: save me  
From this wicked world I'm livin' in 
She said: save me  
I don't wanna lose, I wanna win  
I can't run and I can't hide 
I can't run and I can't hide 
She said: save me 
She said save me... 
  
Save me, girl 
Save me, girl 
Save my soul 
Save me, girl 
Save my soul 
Save me, girl 
Save my soul, baby 
Save me girl 
Ooh... 
Save me, girl 
Save my soul 
You can't run 
You can't hide 
Come on, baby 
Hoo!  
Save my soul...  
Ooh!

She's out of my life  
She's out of my life  
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry  
I don't know whether to live or die  
And it cuts like a knife  
She's out of my life 
It's out of my hands  
It's out of my hands  
To think for two years she was here  
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier  
Now the way that it stands  
She's out of my hands 
So I've learned that love's not possession  
And I've learned that love won't wait  
Now I've learned that love needs expression  
But I learned too late 
She's out of my life  
She's out of my life  
Damned indecision and cursed pride  
Kept my love for her locked deep inside  
And it cuts like a knife  
She's out of my life

Your precious sweetheart, she's so faithful  
She's so true, oh yeah  
Her dreams are tumblin'  
Her world is crumblin'  
Because of you, uh uh  
One day you'll hurt her just once too much  
And when you finally lose your tender touch 
  
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day  
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray  
Shoo-be-doo-be-doo-be-doo-da-day  
You gonna send your baby straight to me 
I'm gonna give her all the lovin'  
Within my heart, oh yeah  
I'm gonna patch up every single little dream  
You torn apart, understand me now?  
And when she tells you she's cried her last tear  
Heaven knows I'm gonna be somewhere near 
 
Oh yeah-yeah, you better  
You better listen to me, yeah 
Heartaches are callin' and tears are fallin'  
Because of you, oh yeah  
And when you're gone she'll know  
I'm the one to go to her rescue  
Maybe you didn't know that baby  
You're gonna leave her one too many times  
And when you come back that  
Girl's gonna be mine, all mine

She dances in these sheets at night  
She dances to his needs  
She dances 'til he feels just right  
Until he falls asleep  
She dances at the crack of dawn  
And quickly cooks his food  
She can't be late, can't take too long  
The kids must get to school 
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of,  
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love 
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of,  
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love 
She dances for the man at work  
Who works her overtime  
She can't be rude as she says,  
"I must be home tonight."  
She dances to the kitchen stove  
Dinner is served by nine  
He says his food's an hour late  
She must be outta her mind 
  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
She's a slave to the rhythm of  
She's a slave to the rhythm  
A slave to the rhythm of,  
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love 
She works so hard, just to make her way  
For a man who just don't appreciate  
And though he takes her love in vain  
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains  
She danced the night that they fell out  
She swore she'd dance no more  
But then she did, he did not quit as she ran out the door 
She danced through the night in fear of her life  
She danced to a beat of her own  
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride  
She knew she was needed back home, home 


Smile, though your heart is aching  
Smile, even though it's breaking  
When there are clouds in the sky  
You'll get by 
If you smile  
With your fear and sorrow  
Smile and maybe tomorrow  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile  
If you just 
Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear may be ever so near  
That's the time you must keep on trying  
Smile, what's the use of crying  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile  
If you just 
Smile, though your heart is aching  
Smile, even though it's breaking  
When there are clouds in the sky  
You'll get by 
If you smile  
Through your fear and sorrow  
Smile and maybe tomorrow  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile  
If you just smile 
That's the time you must keep on trying  
Smile, what's the use of crying  
You'll find that life is still worthwhile  
If you just smile

As he came into the window  
It was the sound of a crescendo  
He came into her apartment  
He left the bloodstains on the carpet  
She ran underneath the table  
He could see she was unable  
So she ran into the bedroom  
She was struck down, it was her doom 
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok  
Are you ok, Annie  
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok  
Are you ok, Annie  
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok?  
Are you ok, Annie?  
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie? 
 
 
 
 
 
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok?  
Are you ok, Annie?  
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok?  
Are you ok, Annie?  
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok?  
Are you ok, Annie?  
You've been hit by  
You've been hit by  
A smooth criminal 
So they came into the outway  
It was Sunday - what a black day  
Mouth to mouth  
Resuscitation  
Sounding heartbeats - intimidation 
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok  
Are you ok, Annie  
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok  
Are you ok, Annie  
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok?  
Are you ok, Annie?  
Annie, are you ok?  
So, Annie are you ok, are you ok Annie? 
 
 
 
(Then you  
Ran into the bedroom) 
 
 
 
(You've been struck by  
A smooth criminal) 
Okay, I want everybody to clear  
The area right now! 
Aaow! 
I don't know! 
I don't know! 
I don't know! 
I don't know! 
I don't know! 
I don't know why baby! 
I don't know 
 
  
Dag gone it - baby! 
Dag gone it - baby! 
Dag gone it - baby! 
Hoo! Hoo! 
Dag gone it! 
Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! 
Dag gone it! 
 
Aaow!!!

Heard he grew up in Queens,  
Got a bullet to the brain,  
Dug a step into fame,  
But that don't mean a thing, 
Said he'd rather be king,  
With an absolute reign,  
'Till he finds himself a victim of the game, 
Then his life became serious, 
Marchin' like the soldier,  
Marchin' like a soldier boy,  
Show you the things that make a man a king, 
Marchin' like the soldier,  
Marchin' like a soldier boy,  
Why don't you shine like you're the man again 
People say that you're blind,  
Then they say that you're fine,  
But they won't help you find,  
Find the road again, 
If they won't help you fight  
So they torture your mind  
Then leave you delirious , Oh my

 
 
I'm just an average man  
With an average life  
I work from nine to five  
Hey, hey, I'll pay the price 
All I want is to be left alone  
In my average home  
But why do I always feel like  
I'm in the twilight zone  
And 
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Tell me is it just a dream 
When I come home at night  
I bold the door real tight  
People call me on the phone  
I'm trying to avoid  
But can people on TV see me  
Or am I just paranoid 
When I'm in the shower  
I'm afraid to wash my hair  
'Cause I might open my eyes  
And find someone standing there 
People say I'm crazy  
Just a little touched  
But maybe showers remind me  
Of Psycho too much  
That's why 
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Who's playing tricks on me 
  
I don't know anymore  
Are the neighbors watching me  
Well, is the mail man watching me 
And I don't feel safe anymore  
Oh, what a mess  
I wonder who's watching me now 
The IRS 
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Tell me is it just a dream 
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
And I have no privacy  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Who's playing tricks on me 
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Tell me who can it be 
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Who's playing tricks on me 
I always feel like  
Somebody's watching me  
Can I have my privacy

All alone  
Wishing on stars  
Waiting for you to find me 
One sweet night  
I knew I would see  
A stranger who'd be my friend 
When someone in the dark reaches out to you  
And touches off a spark that comes shining through  
It tells you never be afraid  
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow  
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow  
Like it was written in the stars, I knew  
My friend, my someone in the dark, was you 
"Thank you." 
Promise me  
We'll always be  
Walking the world together 
Hand in hand  
Where dreams never end  
My star secret friend and me 
When someone in the dark reaches out to you  
And touches off a spark that comes shining through  
It tells you never be afraid  
When somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow  
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow  
Look for the rainbow in the sky 
Oh, I believe you and I  
Could never really say goodbye 
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see  
Someone in the dark for me 
Wherever you may be, I'll look up and see  
Someone in the dark for me

I'm so undemanding  
'Cause they so love is blind  
I've lived this life pretending  
I can bear this hurt deep inside  
The truth is that I'm longing  
For love that's so divine  
I've searched this whole world wishing  
She'll be there time after time 
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love 
I've lived my life the lonely  
A soul that cries of shame  
And handicapped emotions  
Save me now from what still remains  
I'll be your story hero  
I'll serenade in rhyme  
I'm just needing that someone  
Save me now, am I the one? 
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love  
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love 
When you say we will dance 'till the light of day  
It's just like the children in Earth's joy  
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay?  
It's because I'm needing that someone 
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out  
A heart that needs your love  
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out 
Someone put your hand out  
I'm begging for your love  
'Cause all I do is hand out  
Love

Your love is magical, that's how I feel  
But I have not the words here to explain  
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion  
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain  
To tell you how I feel  
But I am speechless, speechless  
That's how you make me feel  
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real  
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say  
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray  
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside  
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side  
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found  
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground  
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel  
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real  
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face  
There's no mountain high I cannot climb  
I'm humbled in your grace  
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel  
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real  
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel  
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real  
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel  
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real  
Speechless your love is magical, that's how I feel  
But in your presence I am lost for words  
Words like, "I love you."

I'm headed for the border  
It's on my mind  
And nothin' really matters  
I've got to be on time  
Look in the view mirror  
Is he hot on my tracks  
Is he getting nearer  
I feel some heat is on my back 
 
Speedin' on the freeway  
Gotta get a lead way 
Doin' it on the highway  
Gotta have it my way 
Mind is like a compass  
I'm stoppin' at nothin' 
 Pull over boy and get your ticket right 
And nothin' gonna stop me  
Ain't no stop and go  
I'm speedin' on the midway  
I gotta really burn this road 
 
Speed demon, you're the very same one  
Who said the future's in your hands  
The life you save could be your own  
You're preachin' 'bout my life like you're the law  
Gonna live each day and hour like  
For me there's no tomorrow

I was wandering in the rain  
Mask of life, feelin' insane  
Swift and sudden fall from grace  
Sunny days seem far away  
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me  
Stalin's tomb won't let me be  
On and on and on it came  
Wish the rain would just let me 
How does it feel   
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
When you're alone  
And you're cold inside 
Here abandoned in my fame  
Armageddon of the brain  
KGB was doggin' me  
Take my name and just let me be  
Then a beggar boy called my name  
Happy days will drown the pain  
On and on and on it came  
And again, and again, and again  
Take my name and just let me be 
How does it feel   
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel   
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
When you're alone  
And you're cold inside 
How does it feel   
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
How does it feel   
How does it feel  
How does it feel  
When you're alone  
And you're cold inside 
Like stranger in Moscow  
Like stranger in Moscow  
We're talkin' danger  
We're talkin' danger, baby  
Like stranger in Moscow  
We're talkin' danger  
We're talkin' danger, baby  
Like stranger in Moscow

I'm livin' lonely, baby  
Stranger in Moscow

Confess! To steal the great achievements of  
the people, the accomplishments of the workers"

Speculate to break the one you hate  
Circulate the lie you confiscate  
Assassinate and mutilate  
The hounding media in hysteria  
Who's the next for you to resurrect  
JFK exposed the CIA  
Truth be told the grassy knoll  
The blackmail story in all your glory 
It's Slander  
You say it's not a sword  
But with your pen you torture men  
You'd crucify the Lord  
And you don't have to read it  
And you don't have to eat it  
To buy it is to feed it  
So why do we keep foolin' ourselves 
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Don't make it factual  
Though everybody wants to read all about it  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Don't make it factual, actual  
They say he's homosexual 
In the hood  
Frame him if you could  
Shoot to kill  
To blame him if you will  
If he dies sympathize  
Such false witnesses  
Damn self righteousness  
In the black  
Stab me in the back  
In the face  
To lie and shame the race  
Heroine and Marilyn  
The headline stories of  
All your glory 
It's slander  
With the words you use  
You're a parasite in black and white  
Do anything for news  
If you don't go and buy it  
Then they won't glorify it  
To read it sanctifies it  
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves 
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Don't make it factual  
Everybody wants to read all about it  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Don't make it factual  
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it 
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Don't make it factual  
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it  
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Don't make it factual, actual  
She's blonde and she's bisexual 
Scandal  
With the words you use  
You're a parasite in black and white  
Do anything for news  
And you don't go and buy it  
Then they won't glorify it  
To read it sanctifies it  
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves  
Slander  
You say it's not a sin  
But with your pen you torture men  
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves 
Just because you read it in a magazine  
Or see it on the TV screen  
Don't make it factual  
Though everybody wants to read all about it

You're so damn disrespectable  

Take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
That's with you baby  
Ah take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
That's with you baby 
I thought the grass was green on the other side  
Thought the sun shone brighter without saying goodbye  
There's a card in my hand  
Tears fall like rain  
I want to come home again  
I want you to 
Take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
That's with you baby  
Take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
That's with you baby  
Ain't no love in this world  
Ain't no love in this world without you 
In my search to find myself  
I saw your face and nothing else  
Every place I go everything I do  
I still feel the need for you  
Come on and 
Take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
That's with you baby  
Ah take me back  
Take me back where I belong  
That's with you baby 
I'm on my way back to you  
And I want to make it up to you  
And all the problems that I caused you  
If ti takes my life I'll make it up to you  
I just want you to take me, take me  
Take me, take me, take me, take me 
Take me back, forgive me  
Take me back where I belong  
If you can, if you can find it  
In your heart to forgive me

If You  do really exist  
You can hear me begg  
This one little human being here  
Wants to talk with you, step forward and ahead 
You gave me a life  
Now show me how to live with it  
Because I'm all lost in directions  
And I need your help 
If You truly are there   
Answer to my prays, would you please  
On my knees, waiting it so thirsty like haven't been drinking in years 
If You  do really exist  
You can hear me begg  
This one little human being down here  
Wants to talk with you, step forward and ahead 
You gave me a life  
Now show me how to live with it  
Because I'm all lost in directions  
And I need your help 
Lord, all my life I've been owned to you  
Not an single word against yours  
Lord, all I've tried is live under your eyes  
And been a good boy 
But you have seen me 
So you know, that I've fallen as well 
  
If You  do really exist  
You can hear me begg  
This one little human being here  
Wants to talk with You, step forward and ahead  
I need to talk with You  
I need to talk with You  
Just to talk with You

Moonlight took me by surprise  
'light coming from your eyes  
Are you with me  
Am I here with you  
Are we in paradise  
Tell me I'm not dreamin' 
I know I've been here before  
You go, then you come back for more  
It's a mystery how you disappear  
Like a shadow in the night  
Tell me I'm not dreamin' 
  
Are you too good to be true  
Tell me I'm not dreamin'  
Are you too good to be true  
Tell me I'm not dreamin' 
Midnight images of you  
You slipped, slipped into my room  
Could be magic, could be fantasy  
Could it be that we're in love  
Tell me I'm not dreamin' 
Your voice whispers in the dark  
You talk, talking to my heart  
Are you with me  
Am I here with you  
Are we in paradise  
Tell me I'm not dreamin' 
 
When the morning comes  
Wake me with your love  
Let me know that I'm not dreamin'  
Tell me this is real  
Show me how you feel  
Say it's what we both believe in 


Just when everything was making sense.  
You took away all my self-confidence.  
Now all that I've been hearing must be true.  
I guess I'm not the only boy for you. 
But that's what I get  
That's what I get  
That's what I get  
That's what I get  
How could you turn us into this?  
After you just taught me how to kiss you.  
I told you I'd never say goodbye.  
I'm slipping on the tears you made me cry.  
But that's what I get.  
That's what I get.  
That's what I get.  
That's what I get.  
For trusting you.  
That's what I get.  
Why does it come as a surprise.  
To think that I was so naive.  
Maybe didn't mean too much.  
But it meant everything to me.
